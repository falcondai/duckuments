# Image filtering {#image-filtering status=draft}

Assigned: Matt

**Background**: Discrete-time signal processing

Note: We currently don't have a preliminary section on signal processing and it's probably sufficient to point readers to a good reference (e.g., Oppenheim and Schafer).

**Topics**

Note: May want to stick to linear filtering

* Motivation (example)
* Convolution: definition and properties (including differentiation)
* Linear filters: examples (sharpening and smoothing)
* Gaussian filters
    * kernels
    * properties (convolution with a Gaussian, separability)
