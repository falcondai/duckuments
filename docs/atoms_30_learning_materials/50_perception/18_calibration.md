# Camera calibration {#camera-calibration status=draft}

Assigned: Matt

Note: The discussion of intrinsic and extrinsic models could be moved up to the geometry subsection

**Topics**

* Why calibration?
* Intrinsic parameters: idealized perspective projection; pixel scaling (square and non-square); offset; skew.
* Intrinsic model expressed in homogeneous coordinates
* Extrinsic parameters: translation and rotation of camera frame (non-homogeneous and homogeneous)
* Combined expression for intrinsic and extrinsic
* Calibration targets
* Calibration models
