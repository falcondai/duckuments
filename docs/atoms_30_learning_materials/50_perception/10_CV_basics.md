# Computer vision basics {#CV_basics status=draft}

Assigned: Matt

For the interested reader, there are several excellent books that discuss fundamental topics in computer vision. These include (in no particular order), [Computer Vision: Algorithims and Applications](#bib:szeliski10) (available online), [Computer Vision: A Modern Approach](#bib:forsyth11) and [Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision](#bib:hartley04).

### Computer vision: What and why?


**Topics**:

* **Objective**: Discover what is present in the world, where things are, and what actions are taking place from image sequences. In the context of robotics, this corresponds to learning a (probabilistic) world model that encodes the robot's environment, i.e., building a representation of the environment.
* History of computer vision
    * Summer Vision Project
    * OCR (license plates, signs, checks, mail, etc.)
    * Face detection
    * Structure from motion
    * Dense reconstruction
    * Augmented reality
    * Applications to self-driving cars and beyond
