Other metrics can be defined to measure the "length" of a vector. Here, we report some commonly used norms. For a more in depth discussion of what consitutes a norm, and their properties:

see: [](#norms),

### $p$-norm {#vec-p-norm}

Let $p \geq 1 \in \reals$. The $p$-norm is defined as:

\begin{definition}[$p$-norm]\label{def:vec-p-norm}
\begin{align} \label{eq:vec-p-norm}
\|\avec{v}\|_p = \displaystyle \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |v_i|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}.
\end{align}
\end{definition}

The $p$-norm is a generalization of the $2$-norm ($p=2$ in \eqref{eq:p-norm}) introduced above ([](#vec-2-norm)). The following $1$-norm and $\infty$-norm can as well be obtained from \eqref{eq:vec-p-norm} with $p=1$ and $p \rightarrow \infty$ respectively.

### One norm {#vec-one-norm}

The $1$-norm is the sum of the absolute values of a vector's components. It is sometimes referred to as the _Taxicab norm_, or _Manhattan distance_ as it well describes the distance a cab has to travel to get from a zero starting point to a final destination $v_i$ on a grid.

\begin{definition}[$1$-norm]\label{def:vec-one-norm}
Given a vector $\avec{v} \in \reals^n$, the $1$-norm is defined as:
\begin{align} \label{eq:vec-one-norm}
\|\avec{v}\| = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n}|v_i|.
\end{align}
\end{definition}

### $\infty$-norm {#vec-inf-norm}

The infinity norm measures the maximum component, in absolute value, of a vector.

\begin{definition}[$\infty$-norm]\label{def:vec-inf-norm}
\begin{align} \label{eq:vec-inf-norm}
\|\avec{v}\| = \displaystyle \max(|v_1|, \cdots, |v_n|).
\end{align}
\end{definition}
