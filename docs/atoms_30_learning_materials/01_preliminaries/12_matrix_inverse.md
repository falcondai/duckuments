## Adjugate matrix

$\amat{A}\text{adj}(\amat{A}) = \text{det}(A)\amat{I}$

<!--
In linear algebra, the adjugate, classical adjoint, or adjunct of a square matrix is the transpose of its cofactor matrix.

The adjugate has sometimes been called the "adjoint", but today the "adjoint" of a matrix normally refers to its corresponding adjoint operator, which is its conjugate transpose.

## Matrix Inverse {#matrix-inverse}

Square matrix:

$\amat{A}\amat{A}^{-1} = \amat{I}$


## Nonsingularity of a matrix
<!--
Let A be a n × n (square) matrix. Then the following are equivalent:
(a) A is invertible.
(b) A is row equivalent to the n × n identity matrix.
(c) The homogeneous system of equations Ax = 0 has a unique (namely, the trivial) solution.
(d) The system of equations Ax = b has a unique solution for every b in R
n
.
(e) The system of equations Ax = b is consistent for every b in R
n
.
(f ) det A 6= 0.
