# Modularization and Contracts {#modules-and-contracts status=draft}

Assigned: Andrea Censi

## Monolithic vs modular design

Why do we want to separate things into modules?

- Now we can divide the work among different people.


Now we need interfaces


## Contracts

We call "contracts" the guarantees that modules give to each other.

We organize the discussion as follows:

- API: Types and signatures
- Timing: Latency, frequency, availability
- Resources: Computation and memory
- Semantics
- Quality: Reliability / probability

## Level 0: API (Types and signatures)

TODO: to write

## Level 1: Timing: latency, frequency, availability

TODO: to write

## Level 2: Resources: Computation and memory

TODO: to write

## Level 3: Semantics

TODO: to write

e.g. reference frames

## Level 4: Quality

Reliability, probability
