## Why using middleware

* Reusable code

* Abstraction


Assumes:
k:code-reusability,
k:code-abstraction,
k:code-encapsulation.

## What middleware provides

### Marshalling

Also known as "serialization". In Python, this is called "pickling".

### Service discovery

Service discovery: do I know who to contact

<example>
Pinging `.local` addresses

</example>

### Scheduling

Deciding when to do some processing

## A few alternatives of robotics middleware

- ROS

- DDS

- LCM


## Trade-offs and design considerations

### Starting curve vs long-term productivity
