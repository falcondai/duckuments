## Disabling Slack email notifications {#disable-slack-emails}

Most importantly, please take the time to disable email notification for Slack.

The point of Slack is that you don't get email. You can work on Duckietown

## Disabling Slack pop-up notification on the desktop {#disable-slack-notifications}

Also remove pop up notifications from the app. It should be a discrete notification that says "hey, when you have some time, look at Twist", not "HEY HEY HEY PAY ATTENTION TO ME NOW".
