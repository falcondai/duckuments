### Lab access

Duckietown labs will take place at TTIC in Conference Room 537 on the 5th floor.

**Note**: Prof. Sadaoki, the TTIC President, generously offered to let us use his conference room as our lab space during the quarter. It is essential that we take care of the room and leave it in the same condition that we found it in. Please be aware that Prof. Sadaoki may ask us to not use the space for a few hours at a time during meetings.

### The local TAs

Duckietown is a collaborative effort involving close interaction among students, TAs, mentors, and faculty across several institutions. The local TAs at TTIC are:

* Andrea F. Daniele (afdaniele@ttic.edu)
* Falcon Dai (dai@ttic.edu)
* Jon Michaux (jmichaux@ttic.edu)
