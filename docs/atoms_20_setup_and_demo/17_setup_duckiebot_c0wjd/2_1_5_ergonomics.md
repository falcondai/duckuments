# Interlude: Ergonomics {#ergonomics status=draft}

Assigned: Andrea

So far, we have been spelling out all commands for you, to make
sure that you understand what is going on.

Now, we will tell you about some shortcuts that you can use to
save some time.

Note: in the future you will have to debug problems, and these
problems might be harder to understand if you rely blindly on the shortcuts.


<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Time: 5 minutes.

Results: You will know about some useful shortcuts.

## `set_ros_master.sh`


Instead of using:

    $ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://![robot name].local:11311/

You can use the "`set_ros_master.sh`" script in the repo:

    $ source set_ros_master.sh ![robot name]


Note that you need to use `source`; without that, it will not work.


## SSH aliases

Instead of using

    $ ssh ![username]@![robot name].local

You can set up SSH so that you can use:

    $ ssh my-robot

To do this, create a host section in `~/.ssh/config` with the following
contents:

    Host my-robot
        User ![username]
        Hostname ![robot name].local

Here, you can choose any other string in place of "`my-robot`".


Note that you **cannot** do

    $ ping my-robot

You haven't created another hostname, just an alias for SSH.

However, you can use the alias with all the tools that rely
on SSH, including `rsync` and `scp`.
