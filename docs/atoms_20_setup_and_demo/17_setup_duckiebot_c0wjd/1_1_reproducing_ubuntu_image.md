# Reproducing the image {#duckiebot-ubuntu-image status=ready}

These are the instructions to reproduce the Ubuntu image that we use.

Please note that the image is already available, so you don't need to do this manually.

However, this documentation might be useful if you would like to port the software to a different distribution.

<div class='requirements' markdown="1">

Requires: Internet connection to download the packages.

Requires: A PC running any Linux with an SD card reader.

Requires: Time: about 4 hours (most of it spent waiting for things to download/compile).

Results: A baseline Ubuntu Mate 16.04.2 image with updated software.

</div>

## Download and uncompress the Ubuntu Mate image

Download the image from the page

> [https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/](https://ubuntu-mate.org/download/)

The file we are looking for is:

    filename: ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img.xz
        size: 1.2 GB
      SHA256: dc3afcad68a5de3ba683dc30d2093a3b5b3cd6b2c16c0b5de8d50fede78f75c2

After download, run the command `sha256sum` to make sure you have the right version:

    laptop $ sha256sum ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img.xz
    dc3afcad68a5de3ba683dc30d2093a3b5b3cd6b2c16c0b5de8d50fede78f75c2

If the string does not correspond exactly, your download was corrupted.
Delete the file and try again.

Then decompress using the command `xz`:

    laptop $ xz -d ubuntu-mate-16.04.2-desktop-armhf-raspberry-pi.img.xz

## Burn the image to an SD card

Next, burn the image on to the SD card.

See: This procedure is explained in [](#howto-burn-image).


### Verify that the SD card was created correctly

Remove the SD card and plug it in again in the laptop.

Ubuntu will mount two partitions, by the name of `PI_ROOT` and `PI_BOOT`.


### Installation

Boot the disk in the Raspberry Pi.

Choose the following options:

    language: English
    username: ubuntu
    password: ubuntu
    hostname: duckiebot

Choose the option to log in automatically.

Reboot.

### Update installed software

The WiFi was connected to airport network `duckietown`
with password `quackquack`.

Afterwards I upgraded all the software preinstalled with these
commands:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt update
    duckiebot $ sudo apt dist-upgrade

Expect `dist-upgrade` to take quite a long time (up to 2 hours).


## Raspberry Pi Config

The Raspberry Pi is not accessible by SSH by default.

Run `raspi-config`:

    duckiebot $ sudo raspi-config

choose "3. Interfacing Options", and enable SSH,

We need to enable the camera and the I2C bus.

choose "3. Interfacing Options", and enable camera, and I2C.

Also disable the graphical boot

choose "2. Boot Options”, configure option for startup. -->B1. Console Text console
<!-- In "5. Advanced options", "A3 Memory Split", select 256 MB for the GPU memory. -->


## Install packages

Install these packages.

Etckeeper:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install etckeeper

Editors / shells:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y vim emacs byobu zsh

Git:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y git git-extras


Other:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install htop atop nethogs iftop
    duckiebot $ sudo apt install aptitude apt-file

Development:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y build-essential libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran libyaml-cpp-dev raspberrypi-kernel-headers

Python:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y python-dev ipython python-sklearn python-smbus
    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y python-termcolor
    duckiebot $ sudo apt install python-frozendict
    duckiebot $ sudo apt install python-tables
    duckiebot $ pip install comptests
    duckiebot $ pip install procgraph
    duckiebot $ sudo pip install scipy --upgrade
    duckiebot $ sudo pip install ruamel.yaml --upgrade

Note: scipy --upgrade(0.19.1) took about an hour with ethernet connection.

I2C:

    duckiebot $ sudo apt install -y i2c-tools


## Install Edimax driver

First, mark the kernel packages as not upgradeable:

    $ sudo apt-mark hold raspberrypi-kernel raspberrypi-kernel-headers
    raspberrypi-kernel set on hold.
    raspberrypi-kernel-headers set on hold

Then, download and install the Edimax driver from [this repository](https://github.com/duckietown/rtl8822bu).

    $ git clone git@github.com:duckietown/rtl8822bu.git
    $ cd rtl8822bu
    $ make
    $ sudo make install



## Install ROS

Install ROS.

See: The procedure is given in [](#install-ROS).

## Wireless configuration (old version) {status=deprecated}

There are two files that are important to edit.

The file `/etc/network/interfaces` should look like this:

```
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
# Include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d:
#source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

auto wlan0

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# Wireless network interface
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
```

The file `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` should look like this:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
ssid="duckietown"
psk="quackquack"
proto=RSN
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
pairwise=CCMP
auth_alg=OPEN
}
network={
   key_mgmt=NONE
}
```

## Wireless configuration

The files that describe the network configuration are
in the directory

    /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/

This is the contents of the connection file `duckietown`, which
describes how to connect to the `duckietown` wireless network:

    [connection]
    id=duckietown
    uuid=e9cef1bd-f6fb-4c5b-93cf-cca837ec35f2
    type=wifi
    permissions=
    secondaries=
    timestamp=1502254646

    [wifi]
    mac-address-blacklist=
    mac-address-randomization=0
    mode=infrastructure
    ssid=duckietown

    [wifi-security]
    group=
    key-mgmt=wpa-psk
    pairwise=
    proto=
    psk=quackquack

    [ipv4]
    dns-search=
    method=auto

    [ipv6]
    addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
    dns-search=
    ip6-privacy=0
    method=auto

This is the file

    /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/create-5ghz-network

Contents:

    [connection]
    id=create-5ghz-network
    uuid=7331d1e7-2cdf-4047-b426-c170ecc16f51
    type=wifi
    # Put the Edimax interface name here:
    interface-name=![wlx74da38c9caa0 - to change]
    permissions=
    secondaries=
    timestamp=1502023843

    [wifi]
    band=a
    # Put the Edimax MAC address here
    mac-address=![74:DA:38:C9:CA:A0 - to change]
    mac-address-blacklist=
    mac-address-randomization=0
    mode=ap
    seen-bssids=
    ssid=duckiebot-not-configured

    [ipv4]
    dns-search=
    method=shared

    [ipv6]
    addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy
    dns-search=
    ip6-privacy=0
    method=ignore

Note that there is an interface name and MAC address that need to be changed
on each PI.

## SSH server config

This enables the SSH server:

    $ sudo systemctl enable ssh


## Create swap Space

Do the following:

Create an empty file using the `dd` (device-to-device copy) command:

    duckiebot $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap0 bs=1M count=512

This is for a 512 MB swap space.

Format the file for use as swap:

    duckiebot $ sudo mkswap /swap0

Add the swap file to the system configuration:

    duckiebot $ sudo vi /etc/fstab

Add this line to the bottom:

    /swap0 swap swap

Activate the swap space:

    duckiebot $ sudo swapon -a

## Passwordless sudo {#howto-passwordless-sudo}

First, make `vi` the default editor, using

    $ sudo update-alternatives --config editor

and then choose `vim.basic`.

Then run:

    $ sudo visudo

And then change this line:

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

into this line:

    %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

## Clean up

You can use the command `dpigs` to find out which packages take
lots of space.

    $ sudo apt install wajig  debian-goodies

Either:

    $ wajig large
    $ dpigs -H -n 20

Stuff to remove:

    $ sudo apt remove thunderbird
    $ sudo apt remove libreoffice-\*
    $ sudo apt remove openjdk-8-jre-headless
    $ sudo apt remove fonts-noto-cjk
    $ sudo apt remove brasero

At the end, remove extra dependencies:

    $ sudo apt autoremove

And remove the `apt` cache using:

    $ sudo apt clean

The total size should be around 6.6GB.

## Ubuntu user configuration

### Groups

You should make the `ubuntu` user belong to the `i2c` and `input` groups:

    duckiebot $ sudo adduser ubuntu i2c
    duckiebot $ sudo adduser ubuntu input
    duckiebot $ sudo adduser ubuntu video


You may need to do the following (but might be done already through `raspi-config`): XXX

    duckiebot $ sudo udevadm trigger


### Basic SSH config

Do the basic SSH config.

See: The procedure is documented in [](#ssh-local-configuration).

Note: this is not in the aug10 image.


### Passwordless SSH config

Add `.authorized_keys` so that we can all do passwordless SSH.

The key is at the URL

    https://www.dropbox.com/s/pxyou3qy1p8m4d0/duckietown_key1.pub?dl=1

Download to `.ssh/authorized_keys`:

    duckiebot $ curl -o .ssh/authorized_keys ![URL above]
<!--
### Optional user preferences

Configure to automatically boot into `byobu`:

    duckiebot $ byobu-enable

This can be disabled with `byobu-disable`. -->


### Shell prompt

Add the following lines to `~ubuntu/.bashrc`:

    echo ""
    echo "Welcome to a duckiebot!"
    echo ""
    echo "Reminders:"
    echo ""
    echo "1) Do not use the user 'ubuntu' for development - create your own user."
    echo "2) Change the name of the robot from 'duckiebot' to something else."
    echo ""

    export EDITOR=vim

## Check that all required packages were installed

At this point, before you copy/distribute the image, create a user,
install the software, and make sure that `what-the-duck` does not complain
about any missing package.

(Ignore `what-the-duck`'s errors about things that are not set up yet, like
users.)

## Creating the image

You may now want to create an image that you can share with your friends. They will think you are cool because they won't have to
duplicate all of the work that you just did. Luckily this is easy. Just power down the duckiebot with:

    duckiebot $ sudo shutdown -h now

and put the SD card back in your laptop.

See: The procedure of how to burn an image is explained in
[](#howto-burn-image); except you will invert the `if` and `of` destinations.

You may want to subsequently shrink the image, for example if your friends have smaller SD cards than you.

See: The procedure of how to shrink an image is explained in [](#howto-shrink-image).


## TODO: Git LFS

Note: We should install Git LFS on the Raspberry Pi, but so far AC did not have any luck. See [](#git-lfs-install).
