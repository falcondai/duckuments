### Reminder: Use care when assembling! {#care}

When assembling, be sure to be gentle! Tighten screws just enough so that the parts will remain stationary. When inserting LEDs, gently work them into their holders. While the acrylic is relatively tough, it can be fractured with modest force. We don’t have many replacements (at this moment) so we may not be able to replace a broken part.

### Remove protective paper

Peel protective layer off of all parts on all sides.

### Rear Spacers Reassembly

Disassemble the rear spacers. KEEP ALL HARDWARE (you will be using the 2 short screws that were connected to the bottom of the spacer later). Reassemble in the configuration shown in the images below (note that the rear bumper braces now act as spacers to preserve the height offset). Reinstall the longer M3 screws that were originally connected at the top, and replace the bottom screws with 2 of your M3x10 screws included in the envelope. You may need the pliers to grasp the hex spacers when tightening. Note [Reminder: Use care when assembling!](#care)

### Mount Rear Bumper

Carefully guide rear bumper on to rear bumper brace tabs. Ensure that the hole for charging aligns with the charging port on your battery.

</div>

Locate 4 M3 nuts and 4 M3x10 screws. Place a nut in the wide part of the t-slot and thread a screw into the nut as shown in the following pictures. Note [Use care when assembling!](#care) If you are having trouble with the nuts falling out, take a small piece of transparent tape and place it over both sides of the t-slot with the nut inside. It won’t look as nice but it will be much easier to assemble.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_10">

</div>

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_11">
    <img src="image_11-1.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

The rear bumper should now look like this:

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_12">
    <img src="image_12-1.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Install the left and right rear LEDs carefully by pushing them into their flexure holders. Note [Use care when assembling!](#care)

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_13">
    <img src="image_13.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Install 6 removable cotter pins in the positions below. The top 2 will hold the shell on, the bottom 4 will hold a vehicle detector target (if you have one).

</div>

Congrats! your rear bumper assembly is complete!

### Mount Front Bumper

Take 2 M3x10 screws and 2 M3 nuts and install them as shown in the following pictures. The first picture shows the correct holes to mount these screws (The correct position is the widest pair of 3mm holes beside the camera). The nuts should tightened on by a few threads (these are the two nuts that are not yet tightened at the top of the second picture):

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_15">
    <img src="image_15.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_16">
    <img src="image_16.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Take the front bumper and carefully press the LEDs into the flexure holders. Take care that the wires are routed as suggested. Also note that the front center LED wire should not be crushed between the bumper and the right spacer (you will likely fracture the bumper if you try to force it). The center LED should be bent at a right angle in the direction that the wire is fed through the body.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_17">
    <img src="image_17.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Position the bumper so that the nuts align with the t-slots. You may need to loosen or tigthen the screws to align the nuts. You may also need to angle the front bumper when inserting to get it
past the camera screws.

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_18">
    <img src="image_18.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Gently tighten the nuts. The front bumper should now stay in position (but not done securing yet!)

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_19">
    <img src="image_19.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Remember those short M3 screws that we said to keep track of? Now it’s time to use them! Mount those 2 screws and 2 M3 nuts at the position shown below (to keep the bumper from being tilted up and breaking).

<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_20">
    <img src="image_20.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>
<div figure-id="fig:bumper_figure_21">
    <img src="image_21.jpg" style='width:20em; height:auto'/>
</div>

Slide the 2 remaining removable cotter pins into the holes at the top and congrats! You are finished assembling your front bumper!


### Mount Vehicle Detector Target (optional)

If you were given a vehicle detector target, now it is time to use those removable cotter pins in the back! Attach as shown in the following image. To recharge, simply remove the target and plug in the battery.
