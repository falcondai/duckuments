Duckietowns are the cities where Duckiebots drive. Here, we provide a link to all bits and pieces that are needed to build a Duckietown, along with their price tag. Note that while the topography of the map is highly customable, we recommend using the components listed below. Before purchasing components for a Duckietown, read [](#duckietown-specs) to understand how Duckietowns are built.

In general, keep in mind that:

- The links might expire, or the prices might vary.
- Shipping times and fees vary, and are not included in the prices shown below.

## Duckies

Duckies ([](#fig:duckies)) are essential yet non functional.

</div>

## Floor Mats

The floor mats ([](#fig:floor-mats)) are the ground on which the Duckiebots drive.

We choose these mats because they have desirable surface properties, are modular, and have the right size to be [street segments](#duckietown-specs). Each square is (~61x61cm) and can connect on every side of other squares. There are 6 mats in each package.

<div figure-id="fig:floor-mats" figure-caption="The Floor Mats">
     <img src="floor-mats.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

Each mat can be a segment of road: straight, a curve, or an intersection (3, or 4 way). To design your Duckietown, see [](#duckietown-specs).

## Duck Tape

We use duck (duct) tape of different colors ([](#fig:all-tapes)) for defining the roads and their signals. White indicates the road boundaries, yellow determines lane boundaries and red are stop signs.

The white and red tape we use are 2 inches wide, while the yellow one is 1 inch wide.

<div figure-id="fig:all-tapes" figure-caption="The Duck Tapes">
     <img src="all-tapes.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

To verify how much tape you need for each road segment type, see [](#duckietown-specs).

## Traffic Signs

Traffic signs ([](#fig:signs)) inform Duckiebots on the map of Duckietown, allowing them to make driving decisions.

<div figure-id="fig:signs" figure-caption="The Signs">
     <img src="signs.png" style='width: 15em'/>
</div>

Depending on the chose road topograhy, the number of necessary road signal will vary. To design your Duckietown, see [](#duckietown-specs).
