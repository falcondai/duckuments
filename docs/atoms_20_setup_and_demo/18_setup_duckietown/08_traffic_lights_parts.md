# Traffic lights Parts {#traffic-lights-parts status=draft}

Traffic lights regulate intersections in Duckietown. Here, we provide a link to all bits and pieces that are needed to build a traffic light, along with their price tag. You will need one traffic per either three, or four way intersections. The components listed below meet the appearence specifications described in [](#duckietown-specs).


In general, keep in mind that:

- The links might expire, or the prices might vary.
- Shipping times and fees vary, and are not included in the prices shown below.
- Substitutions are probably OK, if you are willing to write some software.
