### The Duckietown “no burn out” policy ###

Duckietown strives to be a place of joy and relaxed introspection.

This is our “no burn out” policy: We only accept freshmen and sophomores if their freshman/departmental advisors will send us an email containing the sentence “I have reviewed X’s course load, and I think it is a good idea that X spends N hours per week in Duckietown”.

### Positions available ###

We have a variety of positions, suitable for the whole range of seniority, from freshman to senior. We have something for course 2, 6, 16, and everything in between.

This is an incomplete list of possibilities:
- assembling and maintaining the robot fleet
- herding duckies
- QA/writing documentation
- designing and building Duckietowns
- tutor the high school students working on Duckietown
- create websites
- programming
- system administration
- editing a duckumentary
- social media manager (Facebook/Linkedin/…)
- being a Duckie Ambassador
- plus, of course, research-level work in many area of autonomy.

If you want to get an inside view, please contact our previous UROP Jonathan Garcia-Mallen <jogama@mit.edu>, who was performing a large subset of the above during IAP.
