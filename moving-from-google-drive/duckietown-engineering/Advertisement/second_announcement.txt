New class on autonomous vehicles for Spring 2016: MIT 2.166 a.k.a. "Duckietown"


Dear students and colleagues:

For Spring 2016, MIT is offering a new class about the science of autonomy at the graduate level. MIT 2.166 is a hands-on, project-focused course on self-driving vehicles and high-level autonomy.

This is a collaborative effort: 2 Labs (CSAIL and LIDS), 3 Departments (ME, AeroAstro, EECS), and over a dozen people helped created this class, under the supervision of Prof. John Leonard and Prof. Jonathan How. Please see our complete roster at http://duckietown.com/

This is an open source class: all materials (hardware design, software, and teaching materials) will be released as "open source" (a free software license for code; a Creative Commons license for teaching materials).

The student experience:

You will join the recently formed MIT spin-off Duckietown Engineering co., and you will design the autonomous robo-taxis system for the city of Duckietown. (Joining this fictional company on LinkedIn is optional but encouraged.)

You will get:
- A @duckietown.com address
- A Duckiebot to take home. Our policy is "one robot per child".
- At least half of a dedicated mentor per project; that is, each mentor supervises at most 2 students. The expectation is to eventually write a research paper for each project.

Here are some videos to give you a flavor of Duckietown:
- help us make them autonomous: https://vimeo.com/152233002
- take a ride in the Duckiebot: https://vimeo.com/152499589
- the cool side of Duckietown: https://vimeo.com/152825632

Everything is going to be 100% vision based. Perception and computation is completely on board (on a Raspberry PI!). 

The final goal for the class is to implement a complex decentralized coordination behavior based on signaling and 100% vision-based perception: https://vimeo.com/152228864

This is going to an awesome experience! Because of resource constraints, we plan for very limited enrollment. If interested, please sign up here: http://duckietown.mit.edu/signup.html
